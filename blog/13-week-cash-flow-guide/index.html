        <p>If you've ever been surprised by a cash crunch—or watched helplessly as your runway shortened faster than expected—you already know why cash flow forecasting matters. But most businesses do it wrong.</p>

        <p>They rely on annual budgets that become outdated the moment they're approved. Or they build elaborate models that no one updates. Or worse, they fly blind until the bank account tells them there's a problem.</p>

        <p>The 13-week cash flow forecast solves this. It's the single most useful financial tool for operators, and it's the first thing we build when we engage with a new client.</p>

        <h2>Why 13 Weeks?</h2>

        <p>Thirteen weeks is the sweet spot between too short and too long. Here's why:</p>

        <p><strong>It covers a full quarter.</strong> Most business cycles, vendor terms, and reporting periods align to quarters. A 13-week view captures these rhythms.</p>

        <p><strong>It's long enough to see problems coming.</strong> Two weeks isn't enough time to react to most cash issues. Thirteen weeks gives you runway to cut costs, accelerate collections, or secure financing before a crunch hits.</p>

        <p><strong>It's short enough to be accurate.</strong> Forecasting cash six months out is mostly guesswork. Thirteen weeks is far enough to plan, close enough to be reliable.</p>

        <h2>What Goes Into the Forecast</h2>

        <p>A good 13-week cash flow isn't complicated, but it needs to be complete. Here's the basic structure:</p>

        <h3>Cash Inflows</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer collections (by aging bucket if you have AR)</li>
            <li>Other receipts (deposits, refunds, asset sales)</li>
            <li>Financing proceeds (if expected)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cash Outflows</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Payroll and benefits</li>
            <li>Rent and facilities</li>
            <li>Vendor payments (by priority)</li>
            <li>Debt service</li>
            <li>Taxes</li>
            <li>Capital expenditures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Math</h3>
        <p>Beginning cash + inflows - outflows = ending cash. The ending cash for week 1 becomes the beginning cash for week 2. Simple, but the discipline of maintaining it is what makes it powerful.</p>

        <h2>Building Your First Forecast</h2>

        <p>Start with what you know for certain: payroll dates, rent due dates, debt payments, and any committed expenses. These are your "must pays."</p>

        <p>Then layer in your best estimates for collections and discretionary expenses. For collections, use your historical patterns—if customers typically pay in 45 days, don't assume they'll suddenly pay in 30.</p>

        <p>Finally, stress test it. What happens if your biggest customer pays late? What if that deal you're counting on slips? A good forecast shows you both the expected case and the downside.</p>

        <h2>Maintaining the Forecast</h2>

        <p>A 13-week cash flow only works if you maintain it. Here's the rhythm we recommend:</p>

        <p><strong>Weekly updates:</strong> Every week, record actual results for the prior week and extend the forecast by one week. This keeps you perpetually 13 weeks out.</p>

        <p><strong>Variance analysis:</strong> When actuals differ from forecast, understand why. Was it a timing issue or a fundamental miss? Adjust future weeks accordingly.</p>

        <p><strong>Rolling accuracy:</strong> Track how accurate your forecasts are. If you're consistently missing collections, that tells you something about your assumptions—or your AR process.</p>

        <h2>When You Really Need One</h2>

        <p>Every business benefits from a 13-week cash flow, but some situations make it essential:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rapid growth:</strong> Growth consumes cash. A 13-week forecast helps you see working capital needs before they become emergencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Raising capital:</strong> Lenders and investors want to see that you understand your cash dynamics. A 13-week forecast demonstrates financial discipline.</li>
            <li><strong>Distressed situations:</strong> If you're tight on cash, this becomes your most important management tool. Update it daily if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>M&A transactions:</strong> Buyers will want to see your cash flow. Sellers should have it ready.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

        <p><strong>Being too optimistic on collections.</strong> Use actual historical patterns, not what you wish customers would do.</p>

        <p><strong>Forgetting lumpy expenses.</strong> Insurance renewals, tax payments, and annual contracts can create surprise outflows.</p>

        <p><strong>Not stress testing.</strong> Your base case should be realistic, but you also need to know what breaks if things go wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>Set it and forget it.</strong> A forecast that's not updated weekly is just a historical artifact.</p>

        <h2>Getting Help</h2>

        <p>If you don't have a 13-week cash flow—or if yours isn't working—we can help. It's usually the first thing we build for new CFO services clients, and we can have one operational within a week.</p>

        <p>The visibility it provides is immediate, and it often pays for itself by helping you avoid a single late payment fee or missed discount.</p>
