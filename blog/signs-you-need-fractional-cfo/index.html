        <p>Most founders don't wake up thinking "I need a CFO today." The realization usually comes after a painful experience—a cash crunch they didn't see coming, a deal that fell apart due to messy financials, or a board meeting where they couldn't answer basic questions about unit economics.</p>

        <p>A fractional CFO gives you senior financial leadership without the $300K+ annual cost of a full-time hire. But how do you know when it's time? Here are five signs that your business is ready.</p>

        <h2>1. You're Making Decisions Without Real Financial Data</h2>

        <p>If you're guessing at margins, unsure of your true customer acquisition cost, or can't confidently project next quarter's cash position, you have a visibility problem.</p>

        <p>Many growing companies have bookkeepers or accountants who handle compliance—taxes filed, books closed—but that's backward-looking. A CFO builds forward-looking financial infrastructure: dashboards, forecasts, and KPI frameworks that help you make decisions before problems become crises.</p>

        <p><strong>The test:</strong> Can you answer these questions right now?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What's your gross margin by product or service line?</li>
            <li>How much cash will you have in 13 weeks?</li>
            <li>What's your customer lifetime value vs. acquisition cost?</li>
            <li>At current burn, how many months of runway do you have?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you hesitated on any of these, you need better financial infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>2. You're Raising Capital (Or Plan To)</h2>

        <p>Investors and lenders will scrutinize your financials. They'll ask about your model assumptions, your sensitivity analysis, your working capital needs. If you can't speak fluently to these topics, you'll either lose the deal or negotiate from weakness.</p>

        <p>A fractional CFO prepares you for capital raises by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building investor-ready financial models</li>
            <li>Creating compelling pitch deck financials</li>
            <li>Preparing for due diligence questions</li>
            <li>Helping negotiate terms you actually understand</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We've seen founders leave hundreds of thousands on the table because they didn't understand the implications of liquidation preferences or anti-dilution clauses. A CFO on your side prevents this.</p>

        <h2>3. You're Growing Fast (Or Want To)</h2>

        <p>Growth consumes cash. It sounds counterintuitive—more revenue should mean more money, right?—but growth typically requires hiring ahead of revenue, inventory investments, and longer collection cycles.</p>

        <p>Companies that grow without financial discipline often hit a wall. They run out of cash even while hitting revenue targets. They make hiring decisions they can't sustain. They take on debt with terms that strangle future flexibility.</p>

        <p>A fractional CFO helps you grow sustainably by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modeling different growth scenarios and their cash implications</li>
            <li>Identifying when to invest vs. when to preserve capital</li>
            <li>Building the financial infrastructure that scales with you</li>
            <li>Creating accountability through regular financial reviews</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. You're Considering a Major Transaction</h2>

        <p>Buying a company? Selling yours? Taking on a strategic partner? These are high-stakes decisions with permanent consequences, and most founders do them once or twice in their careers.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, the other side of the table—private equity firms, strategic acquirers, investment bankers—does these deals constantly. The information asymmetry is massive.</p>

        <p>A fractional CFO with M&A experience levels the playing field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Valuation analysis that goes beyond simple multiples</li>
            <li>Due diligence preparation (or buy-side diligence support)</li>
            <li>Deal structure optimization for taxes and risk allocation</li>
            <li>Integration planning that preserves value post-close</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Time Is the Bottleneck</h2>

        <p>Founders often become accidental CFOs. They're the ones reconciling accounts, building budget spreadsheets, managing cash, and dealing with banks. It starts small but compounds.</p>

        <p>Every hour you spend on financial operations is an hour not spent on product, sales, or strategy—the areas where founders typically create the most value.</p>

        <p>A fractional CFO takes this off your plate. Not by delegating to someone junior, but by bringing senior expertise that improves the quality of financial work while freeing your time.</p>

        <p>The math usually works: if your time is worth $500/hour to your business, and you're spending 10 hours a week on finance tasks, that's $20K/month in opportunity cost. A fractional CFO costs a fraction of that while delivering better results.</p>

        <h2>Why Fractional vs. Full-Time?</h2>

        <p>A full-time CFO costs $250K-$400K in salary, plus equity, plus benefits. For companies under $20M in revenue, that's often hard to justify—especially when you don't need 40+ hours of CFO work every week.</p>

        <p>A fractional CFO gives you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Senior expertise</strong> without the senior price tag</li>
            <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> to scale up during busy periods (fundraising, M&A) and down during steady state</li>
            <li><strong>Speed</strong> to engage immediately without a 3-month executive search</li>
            <li><strong>Perspective</strong> from someone who's seen similar challenges across multiple companies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Right Time Is Usually Now</h2>

        <p>Most companies wait too long to bring in financial leadership. They wait until the cash crunch, the failed fundraise, or the deal disaster. By then, options are limited and the cost of fixing problems is much higher than preventing them.</p>

        <p>If you recognized your company in any of these signs, it's worth having a conversation. A good fractional CFO will tell you honestly whether you need their help—and if not now, when.</p>
